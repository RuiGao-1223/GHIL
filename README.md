In medical AI, limited sample availability and collection challenges often cause imbalanced training sets for multi-class models. Existing methods for dealing with multi-class imbalance are limited by their non-generality and subjectivity, and this study proposes an innovative new algorithmic framework with wide applicability, namely Grouping-based Hierarchical Incremental Learning (GHIL). Its core concept revolves around sample augmentation to resolve the issue of imbalanced weights during model optimization caused by strict class imbalances. Subsequently, a tiered learning model is employed for training, ensuring adequate data training while mitigating noise introduced by augmentation. To validate the GHIL experimentally, we collected serum Raman spectral data from patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and healthy individuals. A comparative model was a CNN with the same network layers as GHIL. Results indicated the CNN model achieved only a 77.97% accuracy rate with an F1-score of 63.19%, displaying inaccurate predictions and particularly poor performance on minority classes. In contrast, GHIL, utilizing a convolutional layer as a feature extraction layer akin to CNN, achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95.79%. The Precision score, Recall score, and F1-score all exceeded 95%. Results demonstrate the robust applicability of GHIL for learning from imbalanced multi-class data, underscoring its substantial potential for practical applications.
